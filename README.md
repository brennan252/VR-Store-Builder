## Adaption To Shopify Liquid Template
This builder was adapted to create a Shopify custom VR Display section. Code for the section is in the 'vr-display.liquid' file.

A sample Shopify theme using the 'vr-display.liquid' section can be viewed [here](https://vr-builder-test-store.myshopify.com). 
Give password: 'virtual', then go to the 'Shop In Vr' section in the menu.

The 'theme.liquid' was editted to only include the header on the custom page for the vr-display section (instead of both the header and footer -- which all other pages include). Some css tweaks may be needed depending on the theme.

## About
The VRStoreBuilder provides the templateBuild() function which generates a static AFRAME website bundle for a VR webstore.

The templateBuild() function takes an equirectangular image and store information to create a VR shopping experience. Users can interact with buttons and displays imposed on the equirectangular image.

An example generated site can be viewed [HERE](https://infallible-brown-61ca35.netlify.app/): (NOTE: commerce functionality is not enabled in this demo).

## Usage
To setup a store using templateBuild(): 

    - Download this repository, its dependencies, and add a 'public' folder with your site's images and assets to the downloaded local copy.
    - Setup your API with current eCommerce platform.
    - Edit 'scriptTemplates/info-panel-template.txt' to:
        - GET orderCount on init() to display in the viewCartButton
        - POST currentItem on addToOrder() call
    - Prepare an array of objects for items (see '/buildUtitilities/data' for all the properties to include)
    - Call templateBuild() with all images, files, and links in their specified locations.   
    - Host 'public' folder on AWS, Netlify, Bluehost, etc.
    - Add button on main eCommerce linking to the VR site address

## Example
The Demo was generated with this file:
```
    var templateBuild = require('./templateBuild');
    var redWines = require('./buildUtilities/data/redWineSceneData');
    var whiteWines = require('./buildUtilities/data/whiteWineSceneData');

    function compileBundle() {
        // index build (red wine)
        templateBuild(
            items = redWines,
            img360 = "/images/VR-Store-Builder-Demo/redWineScene/redWine360.JPG",
            primaryColor = '#548844',
            logo = "/images/greenLogo.png",
            cartLink = "http://www.aframe.io/",
            storeLink = "http://www.aframe.io/",
            favIconPath = "/images/favicon.png",
            storeTitle = 'VR Store Builder Demo - Red Wines',
            templatePath = './views/index.pug',
            infoPanelJsPath = './public/javascripts/info-panel-index.js',
            indexHtmlPath = './public/index.html',
            linkScenePath = "Page1.html",
            portalImage = "/images/VR-Store-Builder-Demo/redWineScene/whiteWineLink.png",
            linkSceneTitle = "White Wines",
            linkPosition = "0.05 1.95 -1.25",
            portalFolder = "public/",
            logoFolder = "public/"
        ).then(() => { console.log("index build complete") });

        // page 1 build (white wine)
        templateBuild(
            items = whiteWines,
            img360 = "/images/VR-Store-Builder-Demo/redWineScene/whiteWine360.jpeg",
            primaryColor = '#548844',
            logo = "/images/greenLogo.png",
            cartLink = "http://www.aframe.io/",
            storeLink = "http://www.aframe.io/",
            favIconPath = "/images/favicon.png",
            storeTitle = 'VR Store Builder Demo - White Wines',
            templatePath = './views/index.pug',
            infoPanelJsPath = './public/javascripts/info-panel-page1.js',
            indexHtmlPath = './public/Page1.html',
            linkScenePath = "index.html",
            portalImage = "/images/VR-Store-Builder-Demo/whiteWineScene/redWineLink.png",
            linkSceneTitle = "Red Wines",
            linkPosition = "0.05 1.95 -1.25",
            portalFolder = "public/",
            logoFolder = "public/"
        ).then(() => { console.log("Page1 build complete") });
    }

    compileBundle();
```
The objects in items property should look like this: 
```
    'title': "RaymondReserveSelectionMerlo",
    'panelTitle': "Raymond Reserve Selection Merlo - Napa Valley 2018 ($8.99)",
    'description': "Opening with enticing aromas of roasted coffee, vanilla bean and black cherry, this is a structured and bold Merlot. A plush entry of cocoa, dried red fruit flavors and a touch of spice lead to a savory midpalate. This wine has a good velvety texture with fine-grained tannins and a long, rich finish.",
    'img': "/images/VR-Store-Builder-Demo/redWineScene/IMG_1116.jpg",
    'imgFolder': "public/",
    'itemLink': "https://www.cocobonwines.com/",
    "position": "-0.865 1.1 -1.6"
```

## Modifying
To modify a site beyond what is possible through templateBuild()'s properties, 'templateBuild.js', templatePath, 
and/or '/scriptTemplates/info-panel-template.txt' will need to be edited.

    - templateBuild() renders the site's html from the specified pug templatePath file, so edit most templating there.
    - templateBuild() reads the info-panel component code from './scriptTemplates/info-panel-template.txt' file, so edit most of the Javascript there.
   
## Improvements
- Allow greater customization directly through templateBuild().

- Consolidate templateBuild() properties into higher level objects.

- Create Admin UI to mark locations on equirectangular image, input items and assets, and generate a store.

- Add eCommerce integration into templateBuild()

- Expand Test Coverage

## Testing
### Template Build
Make sure the *goal.txt files are taken from the goal for templateBuild() (particularly if you expext changes to html 
or js output code.

Then, run: `npm run-script test-templateBuild` to make sure templateBuild generates html and javascript as expected.

### Expanding Coverage
Should add Unit Tests for 'buildUtilities' and the Aframe component(right now just one 'info-panel-*' component).

## Credits
The info-panel component is adapted from the AFRAME example:
